Measurement
------------
  1 acre = 4047 m2 = 100 cent
  1 hectare = 2.47 acre
  
  1 litre = 1000cm3
  
  1 cubic centimeter  = i millilitre (ml)
  
  Density = kg/m3
  
  density of water = 1000 kg/m3
  
  mercury is 13.6 times denser than water

Chemical Equation
-----------------

  In chemical reaction
      no of protons in an atom unchanged
      no of electrons increase or decrease
      
      Ions are atoms or group of atoms
      
  Cations
      when metals are involved they lose elctrons to form cations
        formation of sodium ion from sodium atom
        
  Monoatomic ions
      ion formed from single atom
  Polyatomic ions
      ions of atoms of different elements (nh)

pressure is directly proportional to depth
presurre acts in all directions
pressure is directly proportional to density
pressure is directly proportional to acceleration due to gravity
p = dpg

density = mass / volume

relative density = density of substance / density of water

Archimedes principle
  weight of object = weight of water displaced
  
  volume of irregular object  = (weight in air - weight in water) / density of liquid

Eukaryotic cells
  have well defined nucleus
  
  Prokaryotic Cell                      Eukaryotic Cell
1. It is generally smaller
(1-10 microns) in size.
                                      It is comparatively larger
                                      (5-100 microns) in size.
2.
It lacks a well organized nucleus as
its nuclear material is not surrounded
by a nuclear membrane.
                                      It contains a well organized nucleus as
                                      its nuclear material is surrounded by a
                                      nuclear membrane.
3. It has a single chromosome.          It has more than one chromosome.
4. Nucleolus is absent.               Nucleolus is present.
5. It lacks membrane bound cell
organelles.
                                        It possesses membrane bound cell
                                        organelles.
6.
Cell division occurs by fission or
budding. Mitotic and meiotic divisions
are absent.
                                        Cell division takes place by mitosis
                                        and meiosis.
                                        
7. Ribosomes are small.                 Ribosomes are large.


Sl.
No.       Plant cell                                    Animal cell
1. Plant cell has an outer rigid cell wall
which is made up of cellulose.                          Animal cell lacks a cell wall.
2. Plant cell is larger than animal cell.               Animal cell is comparatively smaller in size.
3. Plant cell has large vacuoles which
occupy more space in the cell.
                                                        Animal cell usually lacks vacuoles. Even
                                                        if they are present, they are minute in
                                                        size.
4. Centrosome is present only in the
cells of some lower plants.                             All animal cells contain centrosomes.
5. Lysosomes are found only in the
eukaryotic plant cells.                                 Lysosomes are found in all animal cells.
6. Plant cell contains plastids.                        Plastids are absent.
7. Mostly, starch is the storage material.              Glycogen is the storage material.
