  skin
    epidermis
      upper layer of skin
      seperated from dermis by basement membrane
      contains melanocytes which give color to skin
      the deepest layers of epidermis has nerve endings
    dermis
      middle layer
      thick and elastic
      nerves blood vessels hair follicles saebaeceous glands sweat glands 
      sweat glands seperate sweat from blood
